A live preview right in your browser so you don't need to keep sending real emails during development.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
# To let this package to be reused with other packages
pnpm install
# To make it work since pnpm has some issues
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) with your browser to see the result.
