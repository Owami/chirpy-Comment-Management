# System maintenance

We show a fixed banner to our widgets and pages during a system maintenance, we try our best to keep the downtime as short as possible.

During this time, the system may be unavailable. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. The maintenance is being performed to improve system performance, security and unblock new features.

## What you can't do in maintenance mode

You can't post a new comment, delete a comment (as the site owner) or like a comment.

You can't create a new project, delete a project or customize the widget theme.

You can't make comment widget work on your new pages.

You can't edit your profile or delete a notification.

## What you can do in maintenance mode

You can still read the comments, you existing session should be unaffected, so you can still see your projects, themes or analytics.

You can also read the docs and blogs.

Thank you for your patience.
