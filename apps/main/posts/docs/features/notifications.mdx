# Notifications

Chirpy supports multiply notification mechanisms. You'll receive a message when:

- You got a reply
- A user liked your comment
- You got a comment on your site as the owner

## Web push

> A [web push](https://onesignal.com/blog/what-are-web-push-notifications) is a small message alert, websites use web push to connects with users after they've left their website to improve the user experience.

Before Chirpy push a message to you, you need to grant Chirpy the proper permission. Don't worry, we only ask it when you need it.

For example, we ask it when you're posting a comment:

Click "Sure", the browser popup shows up:

Click "Allow" to grant the permission.

You'll get a message once you received a notification. For example:
