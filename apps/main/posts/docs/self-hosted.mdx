# Self-hosted

You can run Chirpy on your server, it's exactly the same product as our Cloud solution, but you have to install, host and manage your own infrastructure while the Cloud version we manage everything for your ease and convenience.

Chirpy is designed to be self-hosted with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), although you don't have to be a Docker expert to use our self-hosted version, but you should have basic knowledge of command-line, Docker and Linux to setup your own Chirpy instance.

> If you have issues or questions with the self-hosted version, you can reach out to our community support on our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy/discussions).

## Version management

Chirpy follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

You can find available Plausible versions on DockerHub. The default latest tag refers to the latest stable release tag.

Version changes are documented in our [GitHub release](https://github.com/devrsi0n/chirpy/releases). Please note that database/graphql schema changes require running migrations when you're upgrading.

## Requirements

### Hardware

You need 2 Linux servers (virtual or physical machines) to host Chirpy server, and Hasura data server. Chirpy server needs at least **1GB RAM, 1 CPU core and 5GB storage**, while Hasura server needs **1GB RAM, 1 CPU core and 10GB storage**.

We've tested this on a minimal spec [digitalocean](https://m.do.co/c/92c5af253f6a)(affiliate link) droplet but any hosting provider works.

### Softwares

Your need a server to **generate** and run docker containers, thus you need these softwares installed on your server:

- Docker@20.10.18 & Docker Compose@1.27.4, follow [this docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) to install
- Nodejs@16.17.1, npm@6+, follow the [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) doc to install

The other server must have Docker & Docker Compose installed, but it doesn't need the other softwares(e.g. Nodejs).

### Domains

You need 2 domains point to your servers before you start, e.g. you can add a A record to your Vercel Domains:
![Vercel DNS](/images/docs/self-hosted/vercel-dns.png)

Our main domain is `chirpy.dev`, thus we can visit our website at `https://test.chirpy.dev` later.

Other DNS providers have similar settings, you can find the docs on their website.

## Installation

Run following commands to generate docker compose and configurations files:

```bash
npx @chirpy-dev/docker-cli init <your-chirpy-domain> <your-hasura-domain>
```
